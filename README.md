# image_mosaic
Easily (and freely) create an image mosaic

Hi, my name is RÃ©mi Lux. I'm currently an intern at Bertin IT, a society known for its main product : Media Centric.
Welcome to my project

### What is it doing ?
My algorithm is using powerful IA to extract features of each pictures of an images library.
Then, it aims to recreate your query image 
### Why is it unique ?
It is the only algorithm on the market which does not cheat by adding the transparent query on the final image.
You can zoom it as deep as you want to see the original photos ! 

And seriously, did u ever saw a algorithm which can recreate a Facebook profile picture by only using Mia Kahlifa
pictures ? Yeah, that what I thought 
### Is it really Working ?
Yes, of course, and you ?
